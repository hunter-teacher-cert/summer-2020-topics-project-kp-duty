# Instructions

We have a series of lessons that are included in the 2 sub-folders in this repo.

## 1-Blockchain

**The `1-Blockchain` folder contains info on how to:**
1. Present Blockchain as an emerging technology
* Students are asked to ideate a new use for blockchain and write a proposal.
* Ideally suited for an ***AP CSP*** course, but it can also be used in *AP CS A* to lead into a programming project using classes and arrays or ArrayLists, *Intro to CS* for extra projects, or even in a *Social Studies* course.
2. Implemented blockchain in a computer program
* Students are asked to create a blockchain program that implements their idea from the first lesson.
* Best suited to ***AP CS A***, but it can also be used in any class where students are able to create classes (like Python and Javascript).

## 2-Bitcoin

**The `2-Bitcoin` folder contains info on how to:
1. Use hashing to create a Merkle tree and root
* Students are asked to use an online SHA-256 generator to make a binary hash tree and produce a hash root (aka Merkle root).
* Suited for any class to talk about hash algorithms and basic cryptography.
2. Mine bitcoins with Proof of Work
* Students are asked to develop an algorithm to find a nonce value to produce a hash value with given requirements.
* Suited for **any CS class after they have covered for loops**.
