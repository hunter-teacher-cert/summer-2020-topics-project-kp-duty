# When should we use Blockchain?
## Objectives:
Students will demonstrate their understanding of blockchain technology by determining a possible application for blockchain technology in their lives and writing / presenting a proposal explaining how blockchain would improve the current system.

## Grade-level / Class:
* AP Computer Science Principles - This could be an exploration of an emerging technology and its impact on society
* AP Computer Science A - This could be a project delved into after the AP exam.

## Background
Blockchain technology is useful wherever we need a secure record of data that is distributed (not stored in one place or controlled by one party). There are many things that make it secure, but that is not the focus of this lesson. Students should focus on the why and the how in this lesson: *Why is blockchain technology useful? How can it improve how we do things?*
